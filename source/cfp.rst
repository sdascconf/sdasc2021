Call for Papers
===============

The 2nd International Scalable Data Analytics in Scientific Computing
(SDASC) workshop invites submissions of original research. The event
will be co-located with the ISC High Performance 2021 conference. More
details are available at:

https://sdascconf.github.io/

The ever increasing importance of methods originating in statistical
inference and their growing use at large cloud computing facilities
leads both the scientific and HPC communities to look into new ways of
applying computational steering and incorporate it into their
large-scale simulations. The SDASC workshop will feature automated data
analysis efforts at the convergence of computational science, HPC,
large-scale data analytics and inference. The focus will be on the
integration of the HPC techniques and statistical learning tasks into
the modern software stack of computational science.

The SDASC workshop will gather experts from the intersection of
computational science, HPC, and machine learning communities. The
committee members are recognized in their respective fields as experts
of note and will assure fulfilment of the goals of the workshop.

This workshop will complement the other events artificial intelligence,
machine learning, and data analytics taking place at ISC 2021.

------------------
Topics of Interest
------------------

A list of topics of interest for speakers and attendees include:

- Scientific data set creation, ingest, curation, labelling, and
  analysis with statistical models and inference
- Incorporating realtime and ad-hoc data analytics into applications and
  their deployment on supercomputing and cluster platforms
- Computational steering through machine learning models and related
  control  theory approaches
- Meta-data and data metrics collection and generation for large data
  collections and output data sets of computational simulations
- Multi-precision training/inference methods and their use on modern
  hardware for simulation data
- Novel use of discriminative and generative machine learning
  approaches for scientific data sets including Adversarial and
  Reinforcement Learning with self-supervision
- Modern HPC storage issues when dealing with integration of
  computational simulation outputs with data analytics software
- Synchronous and asynchronous learning approaches at scale for methods
  related to deep neural network training, stochastic gradient descent,
  loss-function engineering, and related distributed optimization
  techniques
- Model derivation and training for scalable simulations and data sets
- Hyperparameter search and optimization incorporating recent advances
  in Bayesian optimization
- Deployment of statistical models and their implementations such as
  TensorFlow and PyTorch or application-specific tensor frameworks.
- Integration of models with large scale simulations code bases through
  containers (Kubernetes, Docker, Singularity, OpenShift),
  virtualizaiton, colocation, and workflow frameworks

We also welcome cross-cutting submissions that are span some of the
topics mentioned above.

---------------------
Submission guidelines
---------------------

The workshop will use single-blind peer review.  The submitted
manuscripts will be reviewed anonymously but the authors will be known
to the reviewers. Submissions will be scored on the following criteria:
originality, technical strength and correctness as well as significance,
quality of presentation, and relevance to the workshop topics.

With respect to originality: the submitted manuscripts should have _NOT_
appeared at another venue such as conference, workshop, symposium, or
published in a journal.  Also, the manuscript should _NOT_ be under
consideration for another venue or publication.

The accepted papers will be published in Springer proceedings (see
below for deadlines, dates, and format).

Manuscripts will be 12 pages maximum excluding the references (we
encourage authors to include relevant references).
Papers need to be formatted according to Springer's single column LNCS
style (see http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0
for LaTeX and Word templates).

Note: 12 pages LNCS is roughly equivalent to 6 pages in double column
IEEE format.

The submissions are handled by Easy Chair:

----------------------------
Additional Submission Format
----------------------------

We also intent to implement a unique format for submitting workshop
contributions: given the increasing relevance of sustainable software
development and open source community process, and acknowledging many
of the contributions in 2019 promoting software solutions, we will
allow for software submissions based on community-reviewed pull requests.
Specifically, authors can submit software contributions featuring detailed
software documentation, effectiveness and performance analysis by pointing
to a community-reviewed pull request in a versioning system. We will
complement the software review with a blind review assessing the
contribution's innovation level and community benefit, and decide on both,
scientific and software quality upon the acceptance of the contribution.
This workflow was recently proposed as a modern peer-reviewing concept for
computer-based research. Both, traditional contributions and software-based
contributions can be submitted to SDASC, and accepted contributions will be
presented at the half-day workshop and included in the post-conference
proceedings.
