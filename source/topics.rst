  control  theory approaches
* Meta-data and data metrics collection and generation for large data
  collections and output data sets of computational simulations
* Multi-precision training/inference methods and their use on modern
  hardware for simulation data
* Novel use of discriminative and generative machine learning
  approaches for scientific data sets including Adversarial and
  Reinforcement Learning with self-supervision
* Modern HPC storage issues when dealing with integration of
  computational simulation outputs with data analytics software
* Synchronous and asynchronous learning approaches at scale for methods
  related to deep neural network training, stochastic gradient descent,
  loss-function engineering, and related distributed optimization
  techniques
* Model derivation and training for scalable simulations and data sets
* Hyperparameter search and optimization incorporating recent advances
  in Bayesian optimization
* Deployment of statistical models and their implementations such as
  TensorFlow and PyTorch or application-specific tensor frameworks.
* Integration of models with large scale simulations code bases through
  containers (Kubernetes, Docker, Singularity, OpenShift),
  virtualizaiton, colocation, and workflow frameworks
* Pretrained models' creation, use, and scaling for scientific simulations
