Contributing
============

We are encouraging contributions that present original unpublished
research.  Submissions (up to 12 pages) should adhere to the
single-column LNCS style
(http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0).  Topics
of interest include but are not limited to the following topic areas:

* Scientific data set creation, ingest, curation, labelling, and
  analysis with statistical models and inference
* Incorporating realtime and ad-hoc data analytics into applications and
  their deployment on supercomputing and cluster platforms
* Computational steering through machine learning models and related
  control  theory approaches
* Meta-data and data metrics collection and generation for large data
  collections and output data sets of computational simulations
* Multi-precision training/inference methods and their use on modern
  hardware for simulation data
* Novel use of discriminative and generative machine learning
  approaches for scientific data sets including Adversarial and
  Reinforcement Learning with self-supervision
* Modern HPC storage issues when dealing with integration of
  computational simulation outputs with data analytics software
* Synchronous and asynchronous learning approaches at scale for methods
  related to deep neural network training, stochastic gradient descent,
  loss-function engineering, and related distributed optimization
  techniques
* Model derivation and training for scalable simulations and data sets
* Hyperparameter search and optimization incorporating recent advances
  in Bayesian optimization
* Deployment of statistical models and their implementations such as
  TensorFlow and PyTorch or application-specific tensor frameworks.
* Integration of models with large scale simulations code bases through
  containers (Kubernetes, Docker, Singularity, OpenShift),
  virtualizaiton, colocation, and workflow frameworks

Additional Submission Format
----------------------------

We also intent to implement a unique format for submitting workshop
contributions: given the increasing relevance of sustainable software
development and open source community process, and acknowledging many of
the contributions in 2019 promoting software solutions, we will allow
for software submissions based on community-reviewed pull requests.
Specifically, authors can submit software contributions featuring
detailed software documentation, effectiveness and performance analysis
by pointing to a community-reviewed pull request in a versioning system.
We will complement the software review with a blind review assessing the
contribution's innovation level and community benefit, and decide on
both, scientific and software quality upon the acceptance of the
contribution.  This workflow was recently proposed as a modern
peer-reviewing concept for computer-based research. Both, traditional
contributions and software-based contributions can be submitted to
SDASC, and accepted contributions will be presented at the half-day
workshop and included in the post-conference proceedings.

------------------------------------
Conference Logistics and Proceedings
------------------------------------

The authors of accepted contributions will get a 30 minute time slot
during the workshop to present their work. The revised versions of
accepted papers will be published as post-conference proceedings. This
year, the ISC workshop chairs organize a joint Workshop Proceedings that
will be published with Springer similar to the ISC 2020 research papers
proceedings. The workshop proceedings will be published after the
conference but we will collect preliminary versions of the papers and
make them available during the workshop to your workshop attendees.
